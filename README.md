# Exploitation Tools

This repository contains tools used by Thalium to facilitate exploitation during CTF.

Tools are follows:

* `template_script.py`: a custom [pwntools](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools) template
  * See blog post of [Cyber Apocalypse 2021 1/4 - PWN challenges](https://thalium.github.io/blog/) on Thalium blog to see how to use it
